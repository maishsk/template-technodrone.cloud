Hi, my name is Maish Saidel-Keesing and welcome to my new piece of real estate on the web. 

This is v2 of my blogging journey. I used to blog at [Technodrone](https://technodrone.blogspot.com), and decided in 2019 to move my content here.

I am currently a Senior Solution Architect for Amazon Web Services in Israel and have been working in the technology space for over 20 years.

Automation is the way things should be done - so I am constantly looking for ways to make my life easier wherever I can.

My latest project is [The Cloudwalkabout](http://cloudwalkabout.com) - a book about my journey through the world of AWS. 

I also co-authored the [VMware vSphere Design](http://amzn.to/vF48MQ) book and the [OpenStack Architecture Design Guide](https://technodrone.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-openstack-architecture-design-guide.html) and participated in the technical review of a number of publications.

I am the married to the most wonderful woman, the love of my life, and have 3 amazing and beautiful daughters.

You can always get hold of me through the [Contact Page](https://blog.technodrone.cloud/pages/contact) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maishsk).
